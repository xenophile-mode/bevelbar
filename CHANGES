Release history for bevelbar

v20.09  2020-09-26
  [Added]
  - Option "-C": This makes bevelbar print its "runtime configuration"
    and then quit. Currently, this only prints the height of the
    drawable area, which depends on the font size. If you want to
    display images, this option can be used to determine an appropriate
    image size.

v20.05  2020-05-15
  [Changed]
  - Default font is now "Misc Fixed" instead of "fixed". It's supposed
    to be the same font, just with a different name. See also:
    https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype/2017-01/msg00019.html
  - Makefile: We now use pkg-config for better portability.

v20.03  2020-03-11
  [Added]
  - bevelbar-time has been added as an alternative to shell script loops
    like "while sleep 1; do ...; done | bevelbar", because they can be
    rather expensive due to all the forks.

v18.06  2018-06-24
  - This is a maintenance release, due to the project moving away from
    GitHub. No code changes.

v17.10  2017-10-18
  [Fixed]
  - We now use XRRGetMonitors(). In contrast to XRRGetScreenResources(),
    it does not cause the X server to hang for a few hundred
    milliseconds.

v17.09  2017-09-16
  [LICENSING]
  - The project has been relicensed under the MIT license (more
    precisely called "Expat License", but everyone calls it "MIT
    license" these days).

v16.11  2016-11-13
  [Fixed]
  - When reading input from STDIN, we now limit the buffer to about 64k.
    Previously, it was unlimited, meaning faulty scripts could make
    bevelbar eat all your memory.

  [Added]
  - Validate magic number of farbfeld images as a quick sanity check.

v16.08  2016-08-20
  [Added]
  - Support for displaying farbfeld images.

  [Changed]
  - Command line arguments have been reworked. They now all have default
    values and can be set using getopt. This definitely is backwards
    incompatible.

v16.06  2016-06-26
  [Changed]
  - Try to detect duplicated/cloned monitors.

v16.03  2016-03-13
  [Fixed]
  - Overlong bars no longer appear partially on the wrong monitor.

  [Changed]
  - "Inter segment spacing" is now "segment margin": Around a segment,
    there is both a horizontal and a vertical margin.
  - Both the size of the (new) segment margin and the size of empty
    segments are now measured in pixels (instead of depending on the
    font size).

v16.02  2016-02-01
  [Added]
  - Initial release.
  - Draw bars.
  - Manpage.
